            <u>Introduction</u>
        </h2>





        <p align="center"><b>A play school is a place where around 10-
                20 children spend 1-2 hours each day under the
                supervision of a couple of teachers. "The
                supervisor-child ratio should ideally be around
                1:10". The play schools have a lot to offer, and
                that the play schools should not be aimed at
                developing academic skills like reading and
                writing. There should be no set goals or any stress
                on performance; the focus should be on the
                sensory-motor development and the social
                development of the child. I am very much an
                advocate of play schools since they develop ageappropriate behavior at the right time.

                <font face="algerian"><u>1. The Importance of Play Schools</u></font>
                &nbsp;- &nbsp;This is the first exercise in which children are
                separated from the comfort and secure zone of
                their parents. Therefore, it has to be a place which
                is a second home to the child; a place, which has
                enough material to attract and make the child feel
                comfortable and secure.
                This is the first place where the child builds
                his/her self-esteem. A child learns the importance
                of his own name, things and friends. Every child
                learns to communicate with his teachers and
                fellow students in the Pre School. It is the right
                place for the child‘s foundation for lifelong
                progress. The skills and knowledge that the child develops in the Pre School have a great impact on
                the aptitude and attitude of the child later in life.
                Researches on Pre School education have shown
                that children taught at an early age usually have
                improved social skills, fewer behavioral problems
                and better grades without special and attention.
                Self confidence gained by learning in a playful
                manner adds to the personality development of the
                child. The child‘s positive learning attitude, the
                basic foundation in language, comprehension and
                management, help the teacher facilitate the child‘s
                learning at kindergarten and higher levels of
                education.
                Moreover childhood education specialists claim
                that young children learn best when they have an
                opportunity to interact with their peers, and their
                parents and instructors treat them kindly. They
                bloom well in a tension free environment..
