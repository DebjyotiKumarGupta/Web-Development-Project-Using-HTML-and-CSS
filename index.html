    <p>In an age when school was restricted to children who had already learned to read and write at home, there were
        many attempts to make school accessible to orphans or to the children of women who worked in factories.

        In 1779, Johann Friedrich Oberlin and Louise Scheppler founded in Strassbourg an early establishment for caring
        for and educating pre-school children whose parents were absent during the day.[5] At about the same time, in
        1780, similar infant establishments were established in Bavaria[6] In 1802, Pauline zur Lippe established a
        preschool center in Detmold.

        In 1816, Robert Owen, a philosopher and pedagogue, opened the first British and probably globally the first
        infant school in New Lanark, Scotland.[7][8][9] In conjunction with his venture for cooperative mills Owen
        wanted the children to be given a good moral education so that they would be fit for work. His system was
        successful in producing obedient children with basic literacy and numeracy.[10]

        Samuel Wilderspin opened his first infant school in London in 1819,[11] and went on to establish hundreds more.
        He published many works on the subject, and his work became the model for infant schools throughout England and
        further afield. Play was an important part of Wilderspin's system of education. He is credited with inventing
        the playground. In 1823, Wilderspin published On the Importance of Educating the Infant Poor, based on the
        school. He began working for the Infant School Society the next year, informing others about his views. He also
        wrote "The Infant System, for developing the physical, intellectual, and moral powers off all children from one
        to seven years of age".</p>
